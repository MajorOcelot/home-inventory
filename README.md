# Home Inventory

This is my personal home inventory application written in C#.

The roadmap for this project will provide a somewhat unnecessarily robust application for the use-case.  

That's okay, though.

This application's current packages:  
- SQLite  

Packages in the works:
- Newtonsoft.JSON
- Some kind of PDF export
